Sometimes you just need to do some face recognition and you donâ€™t want to go through the hassle of developing a deep learning model, training it on thousands upon thousands of faces and tuning its hyper-parameters until it somewhat works.  
Sometimes you just need face recognition, right now.  
And I'll show you the quickest way to add face recognition to your project, which works, surprsingly - really well.

### Requirements
First, we'll need to install this repository: [https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition).  
To do that, make sure you install `dlib` according to [this instructions](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf).  
Then simply run `pip3 install face_recognition` (or `pip2` if you're using Python 2).

### Locating faces
Let's take this image for example:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie.jpg)

Let's load the image using Pillow in Python:
```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('group_selfie.jpg')
img = img.resize((800, 600), Image.ANTIALIAS)
img = img.convert('RGB')
img.show()
```
We resize our image to `800x600` to make the face recognition faster without affecting accuracy at all.

Let's get the face locations in the image using the `face_recognition` lib we installed above - should take around 2 seconds:
```python
import numpy as np
import face_recognition

data = np.array(img)
locations = face_recognition.face_locations(data)
print(locations)
```
*If you want to get the faces from multiple images at once, use `batch_face_locations(images)`, it's way faster than iterating the images and calling `face_locations(image)` on each image separately.*

The `locations` value should look like this:
```python
[(180, 510, 366, 324),
 (98, 356, 253, 201),
 (160, 180, 345, 0),
 (168, 741, 297, 612),
 (110, 569, 239, 440)]
 ```
We can see it recognizes 4 faces, each tuple is the rectangle coordinates of a face in the form of `top, right, bottom, left`.
```python
print(len(locations)) # prints: 4
```

### Practical applications
Lets use those rectangle coordinates of each face to actually draw a rectangle in those coordinates for each face.
```python
from PIL import ImageDraw

# We copy the image since we don't want to draw on the original image.
img_copy = img.copy()

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img_copy)
for location in locations:
    top, right, bottom, left = location
    draw.rectangle(((left, top), (right, bottom)), outline=(255, 0, 0), width=3)
del(draw)
img_copy.show()
```
This should result in an image like this:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_mark.jpg)

A common application for face recognition is to blur faces, so let's do that:
```python
# We copy the image since we don't want to draw on the original image.
img_copy = img.copy()

for location in locations:
    top, right, bottom, left = location
    crop = (left, top, right, bottom)
    buffer_crop = img_copy.crop(crop)
    # blur multiple times for a bolder blur
    for _ in range(30):
        buffer_crop = buffer_crop.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
    img_copy.paste(buffer_crop, crop)
img_copy.show()
```
This should result in an image like this:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_blur.jpg)

Another common application is to get a crop of each face, so let's do that:
```python
for index, location in enumerate(locations):
    top, right, bottom, left = location
    crop = (left, top, right, bottom)
    face = img.crop(crop)
    face.show()
```
This should result in images like this:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_crop0.jpg)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_crop1.jpg)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_crop2.jpg)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_crop3.jpg)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-11-18-Best-Face-Recognition-in-Python-in-20-Minutes/group_selfie_crop4.jpg)

This concludes the post for face recognition, in the next posts I'll explain:
* How to compare faces (check if a face is of someone).
* Gender classification.
* Locating facial features (eyes, mouth, nose, tongue, ears, hair and such...).
* Sentiment analysis.

But until next time, happy hacking.
