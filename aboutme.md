First and foremost I am a hacker at heart.

Besides just hacking all day, I also like to workout a lot, because it makes me satisfied when I perceive my body as something more than just a transportation vehicle for my brain.

I enjoy company too, no evening is better than to drink beer with friends and just laugh at nerdy jokes, by the way if you're one of those guys then contact me.
